# Jet Lag map

This is a map of challenges and routes taken in the series Jet Lag: The Game. I have built it using mapboxgl, ReactJs, and Vite. It currently runs somewhat slowly as it is not yet optimized, but I hope to fix this in the future. I have manually inputted data from the first 3 seasons, and aim to eventually have all the seasons on there.

## Features

- Global or per season map view
- Markers for challenges with full information, including veto stamps if appropriate
- Tracks colour-coded per team, showing the routes taken
- Highlights for certain areas of the map when pertinent to the game (see seasons 1 and 3)


## Usage

You can download it and run it yourself with `npm run dev`, or you can go to the website: `https://jetlag-data-map.vercel.app/`.
